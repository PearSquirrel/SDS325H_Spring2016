title: Week 3 (February 1-3, 2016)
---

On Monday, we will finish up our discussion of nonlinear regression by introducing the idea of transformations to fit simple parametric curves.  
* transformation of variables  
* exponential models  
* interpreting exponential models: doubling time and half life  
* power-law models and the double-log transformation  
* additive versus multiplicative residuals in a power law  
* interpreting power laws: elasticity  

On Wednesday, we cover Chapter 3 of the course packet:  
* naive prediction intervals   
* the decomposition of variance (a.k.a. the Pythagorean theorem of statistics)  
Time permitting, we will talk about aggregation paradoxes as a way of introducing the material on grouping variables in Chapter 4.  


### Software

Outside of class, complete the following R walkthroughs.  
- [Economic development and infant mortality.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/infmort/infmort.html)  Using transformations to fit nonlinear curves.  
- [kidney function and aging](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/creatinine/creatinine.html): naive prediction intervals and the decomposition of variance 


### Readings

Please read Chapter 3 of the course packet.


### Exercises  
[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises02-SDS325H.pdf) are about nonlinear regression and aggregation paradoxes.  There is also a little math problem that will have you derive the so-called method-of-moments estimator for linear regression with one variable.
