title: Week 5 (February 15-17, 2016)
---

This week, we will continue with Chapter 5 of the course packet, covering several key ideas:
* bootstrapping   
* introduction to confidence intervals  
* bootstrapped prediction intervals  
* the semiparametric bootstrap (extra topic; not in course packet)  
* permutation tests  
* the Neyman-Pearson approach to testing  

The last two of these topics will likely take us into Wednesday.  Time permitting, we will also begin our discussion of multiple regression (Chapter 6 of the course packet).  


### Readings

Please finish Chapter 5 of the course packet.  If you want to get a head start on multiple regression, start reading chapter 4 of "Data Analysis for Politics and Policy" by Edward Tufte (starting on page 135).  


### Software

Please download race_boot.R, residual_resampling.R, and bootstrapped_prediction.R from the R Scripts tab.  The walkthroughs from last week on bootstrapping and permutation tests have been carried through to this week, as well.  


### Exercises  

Reminder that the due date for last week's exercises (HW 4) has been extended until this Wednesday, 2/24.

[The new exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises05-SDS325H.pdf) involve applying what you've learned about uncertainty quantification to two real problems, one from economics and the other from semiconductor manufacturing.
