title: Week 2 (January 27-29, 2016)
---

On Monday, we'll talk about some basic methods for exploring multivariate data. This material completes Chapter 1 of the course packet.  Key concepts:  
* continuous and categorical/grouping variables  
* contingency tables: relative risk and log odds.  
* simple summaries and graphics: histogram, boxplot, dotplot, scatter plot, lattice plot  
* variation between and within groups.  
* variation among numerical variables.  

On Wednesday, we talk about ordinary least squares for fitting simple regression models. This material covers Chapter 2 of the course packet.  Key concepts:    
* the parameters of a statistical model  
* the least-squares criterion  
* fitted values and residuals in a linear regression model  
* interpretation of the intercept and slope  
* goals of regression analysis.  
* polynomial regression.  

### Software

Complete the following software walkthroughs.  For Monday, the relevant R skills are in:  
- [Introduction to contingency tables.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/titanic/titanic.html).  (You should have worked on this last week, but we'll talk about this data set in class.)  
- [City temperatures](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/citytemps/citytemps.html) in San Diego and Rapid City.   
- [Test scores and GPA for UT graduates.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/sat/sat.html)  

For Wednesday:  
- [Asking prices of pickup trucks.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/pickup/pickup.html)  
- [Utility bills versus temperature.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/utilities/utilities.html).  


### Readings

From the course packet: finish Chapter 1 from last week, and read Chapter 2.    
Good optional readings are [Chapter 2](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/Chapter-02.pdf) and [Chapter 3](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/Chapter-03.pdf) of the Kaplan book.  This overlaps, although not entirely, with Chapter 1 of the course packet.  

Another good optional reading is [Chapter 3](http://jgscott.github.io/STA371H_Spring2016/files/DAPP.pdf) of Tufte's book, pages 65-73.  The examples in this chapter from page 74 onward are also good, but there are a lot of them.  Feel free to consult these if you want to see examples of regression analysis being applied to real social-science problems.  Of particular note is the last example, on interpreting regression models when both variables are re-expressed in terms of their logarithms.  I do recommend you take a look at this one.  

### Exercises

The first set of exercises is available through the [Exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises.html) tab above.  I assigned this last week, but it's not due until February 1st.  Thereafter, we'll have a homework assignment due every Monday.  (You will not need the material on polynomial models or transformations for these exercises.)
