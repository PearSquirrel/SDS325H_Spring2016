title: Week 10 (March 28-30, 2016)
---

This week, we continue our study of probability by learning to build parametric probability models for real-world systems.  

Monday: class cancelled due to illness.  
  
For Wednesday:  
- expected value and variance.  
- the binomial distribution.  
- the Poisson distribution.   
- Monte Carlo simulation based on parametric models.  

If time:  
- the normal distribution.  
- Monte Carlo simulation of stock portfolios.  


### Reading

Please read Chapter 8 of the course packet, on parametric probability models.  

### Software 

Please download the R scripts entitled `parametric_probmodels.R` (for Monday) and `montecarlo_normal.R` (for Wednesday) from the R Scripts tab above.  We will spend a little bit of time going over these in class, and you should finish working through them outside of class.  

### Exercises

There are no exercises this week.
