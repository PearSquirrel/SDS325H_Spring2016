title: Week 14 (April 25-27, 2016)
---

This week, we will learn about survival analysis and hierarchical models (also known as mixed models).

Monday:  
* survival models  
* Kaplan-Meier curves  
* Cox proportional-hazards model  
* Introduction to hierarchical models  

Wednesday:  
* hierarchical linear models  
* if time, hierachical GLMs.  

### Reading

No more course-packet material :-(  [These notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/logitpoissoncox.pdf) have a bit of material on the Cox model.   For hierarchical models, you'll have to rely on your notes from class.  


### Software

Please download the `colon.R` and `bloodpressure.R` scripts for Monday.  For Wednesday, you'll need `ut2000-mm.R` and `polls.R`.  

### Exercises

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises11-SDS325H.pdf) involve fitting a survival model.
