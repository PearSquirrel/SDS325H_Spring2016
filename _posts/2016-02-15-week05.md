title: Week 5 (February 15-17, 2016)
---

On Monday, we will finish up Chapter 4 of the course packet by discussing what happens when we have correlation among the predictors (collinearity) in a regression model.  We will then start on Chapter 5 of the course packet by introducting the idea of a sampling distribution and bootstrapping.

UPDATE: On Wednesday, we will have a guest lecture, due to my jury duty.  The due date for HW 4 is postponed until next Wednesday.  


### Software

Outside of class, complete the following R walkthroughs.  
* [Gone fishing](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/gonefishing/gonefishing.html): using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the sampling distributions of the sample mean and of the least-squares estimator  
* [Creatinine, revisited](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/creatinine/creatinine_bootstrap.html): bootstrapping the sample mean and the OLS estimator; computing confidence intervals from bootstrapped samples.  
* [Titanic, revisited](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/titanic/titanic_permtest.html): permutation tests in 2x2 tables.  

### Readings

Please finish Chapter 4 of the course packet and read Chapter 5.  It is likely that we will not cover the material from the end of page 125 onwards until next week.


### Exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises04-SDS325H.pdf) are about bootstrapping, prediction intervals, and practice with modeling.
