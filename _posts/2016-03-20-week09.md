title: Week 9 (March 21-23, 2016)
---

This week we will begin our study of probability theory.  Topics for Monday:  
- interpretations of probability  
- coherence and Kolmogorov’s axioms  

Topics for Wednesday:  
- conditional probability and Bayes’ rule.  
- random variables, probability distributions, and probability mass functions.  
- expected value and variance.  
- simulating complicated random variables.  


### Reading

Please read Chapter 7 of the course packet, on probability.  In addition, please read the short article entitled ["The Most Dangerous Equation,"](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8863.pdf) by Howard Wainer.  

### Software 

Please complete the [walkthrough linked here](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/montecarlo/montecarlo_intro.html) that introduces you to the Monte Carlo method for approximating a probability distribution in a simple investment problem.  These commands will help you with problem 2 of the homework.  

### Exercises

This week's exercises (Homework 7, from the tab above) are about probability.  They are due in class on Monday, March 28, 2016.
