title: Week 4 (February 8-10, 2016)
---

On Monday, we start Chapter 4 of the course packet.  Key topics:    
* Aggregation paradoxes   
* Dummy variables  
* Multiple grouping variables: main effects and interactions   
* analysis of variance (ANOVA)  

On Wednesday, we will continue with Chapter 4 of the course packet.  Key topics:  
* Numerical and grouping variables together  
* Correlation among the predictors (collinearity)  

### Software

Outside of class, complete the following R walkthroughs.  
* [reaction time in video games](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/rxntime/rxntime.html): modeling numerical outcomes with more than one categorical predictor; dummy variables and interaction terms; analysis of variance.  
* [house prices](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/house/house.html): modeling numerical outcomes with both numerical and categorical predictors.  


### Readings

Please read Chapter 4 of the course packet.  


### Exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises03-SDS325H.pdf) are about nonlinear regression and models involving grouping variables.  You will get an introduction to next week's topic, of sampling variability in regression modeling.
