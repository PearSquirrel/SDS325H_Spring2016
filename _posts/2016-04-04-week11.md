title: Week 11 (April 4-6, 2016)
---

This week, we continue our study of parametric probability models by talking about the normal distribution and the bivariate normal distribution.

Topics for Monday:   
- the stock market.  
- the normal distribution.  
- Monte Carlo simulation of stock portfolios.  
- if time: regression to the mean.  

Topics for Wednesday:  
- the bivariate normal distribution.  
- Chebyshev's inequality.  
- bootstrap resampling.


### Reading

Please read Chapter 9 on the bivariate normal distribution.  In addition, please read the article ["One match to go!" by Spiegelhalter and Ng]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/speigelhalter-EPL.pdf), which you'll need for your homework.  

### Software 

Please download the R scripts entitled `montecarlo_normal.R`,  `bivariate_normal.R`, and `portfolio.R` from the R Scripts tab above.  For the bivariate normal script to work, you will need to first install the `mvtnorm` library in R.  

### Exercises

This week's exercises (HW8, in tab above) are about investment in risky assets, and also (unrelatedly) about soccer.  They are due Monday, April 11.
